# an accepted use of loops might be when there is a iterable needed to be iterated,
# or there is a repeated task need to be done

#For loops
# There are two ways to create loops in Python: with the for-loop and the while-loop.
#
# When do I use for loops
# for loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The for-loop is always used in combination with an iterable object, like a list or a range. The Python for statement iterates over the members of a sequence in order, executing the block each time. Contrast the for statement with the ''while'' loop, used when a condition needs to be checked each iteration or to repeat a block of code forever.

# While loops
# Usage in Python
# When do I use them?
# While loops, like the ForLoop, are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a for loop, the while loop will not run n times, but until a defined condition is no longer met. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.
