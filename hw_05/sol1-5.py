# sol 1:

# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
#
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
#
# A function can return data as a result.


# sol 2+3:

# The keyword def introduces a function definition.
# It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.
# The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.
#
# The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal;
# this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring.
# (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.)
# There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation,
# or to let the user interactively browse through code;
# it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you write,
# so make a habit of it.


#sol 4:

# The return statement returns with a value from a function.
# return without an expression argument returns None.
# Falling off the end of a function also returns None.


#sol 5:

# Use the random library :

# random — Generate pseudo-random numbers¶
# Source code: Lib/random.py
#
# This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

# importing the library:
# import random
